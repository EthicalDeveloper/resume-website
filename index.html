    <!-- A little bit about me -->
<div class="container">
    <p>
        I am currently in software engineering bootcamp living in Dallas, TX.
    </p>
    <p>
        I signed up for the program because the next decade or more will be crucial for software and web development. My desired outcome from this whole learning process is:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>to learn to build a website</li>
        <li>to understand machine logic and built algorithms</li>
        <li>down the road to learn AI & Machine Learning</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        I would love to collaborate with you. Please feel free to <a class="links" href="mailto:wekilow87@gmail.com"><b>contact me</b></a> to discuss further.

            <!-- A little bit about future -->
            <p>
                I graduated with my Bachelor's in Business Administration from The University of Texas at Tyler. Since I always wanted to learn a new language, I started French but got distracted. After software engineering I would like to learn Swift.
            </p>

            <p>
                After the first five years of my career, I would like to switch to data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.
